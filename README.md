# CarPooling App

A new GDSC Project

## Getting Started
Carpooling is a transportation option where multiple people share a single vehicle to travel to a common destination. This can help reduce the number of cars on the road, decrease traffic congestion, and lower air pollution. Carpooling can also save money on fuel and parking costs, and can be a more efficient and convenient way to travel for those who participate. Carpooling can be arranged informally among friends, family, or coworkers, or can be organized through a formal carpooling program or app.
